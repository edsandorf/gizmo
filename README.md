#   gizmo
Gizmo is a collection of useful tools and functions for general statistical analysis and choice modeling. These are functions that I use relatively frequently. Collecting them all in one handy package is useful to me, and it is my hope that others find them useful too.

#   Installing "gizmo"
The package can be install from Github `devtools::install_github("edsandorf/gizmo")`
