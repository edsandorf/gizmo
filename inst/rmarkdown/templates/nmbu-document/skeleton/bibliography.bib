	abstract = {This paper outlines a general procedure for formulating econometric models of population choice behavior from distributions of individual decision rules. A concrete case with useful empirical properties, conditional logit analysis, is developed in detail. The relevance of these methods to economic anaiysis can be indicated by a list of the consumer choice problems to which conditional logit analysis has been applied: choice of college attended, choice of occupa- tion, labor force participation, choice of geographical location and migration, choice of number of children, housing choice, choice of number and brand of automobiles owned, choice of shopping travel mode and destination.},

	abstract = {This paper considers mixed, or random coefficients, multinomial logit (MMNL) models for discrete response, and establishes the following results. Under mild regularity conditions, any discrete choice model derived from random utility maximization has choice probabilities that can be approximated as closely as one pleases by a MMNL model. Practical estimation of a parametric mixing family can be carried out by Maximum Simulated Likelihood Estimation or Method of Simulated Moments, and easily computed instruments are provided that make the latter procedure fairly efficient. The adequacy of a mixing specification can be tested simply as an omitted variable test with appropriately defined artificial variables. An application to a problem of demand for alternative vehicles shows that MMNL provides a flexible and computationally practical approach to discrete response analysis.
